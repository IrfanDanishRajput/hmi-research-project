# Humanizing Technology: Comparing User Experience and Social Perceptions Across Everyday Devices and Applications

## üìÑ Project Description
This repository contains the research, data, and analysis for our study on **user experience (UX)** and **social perception** across a diverse range of everyday technologies.  
We investigate how **pragmatic and hedonic qualities** (measured via *AttrakDiff*) relate to perceptions of **warmth and competence** (from the *Stereotype Content Model*), and how these jointly influence **user engagement intentions**.

## üéØ Objectives
- Compare UX and social perception metrics across eight product types: ChatGPT, Duolingo, Smartwatch, DB Navigator, Spotify, Airfryer, Laptop, and Robot Vacuum.
- Identify which UX and social perception dimensions most strongly predict engagement.
- Visualize product positioning using quadrant mapping and correlation heatmaps.

## üìä Methodology
- **Design:** Within-subject survey for consistent cross-product comparisons.
- **Measures:**  
  - *AttrakDiff* (Pragmatic Quality, Hedonic Quality‚ÄìIdentity, Hedonic Quality‚ÄìStimulation, Attractiveness)  
  - *Stereotype Content Model* (Warmth, Competence)  
  - Engagement Intention (single-item measure)
- **Analysis:**  
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Reliability analysis (Cronbach‚Äôs alpha)  
  - Pearson correlations with Holm corrections  
  - Mixed-effects modeling  
  - Visualizations (quadrant mapping, heatmaps)

## üìà Key Findings
- **Attractiveness** is the strongest predictor of engagement.
- **Pragmatic Quality** aligns more with perceived **Competence**.
- **Hedonic Qualities** align more with perceived **Warmth**.
- AI tools and educational/entertainment apps show higher engagement than utilities/appliances.
